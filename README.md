# Gesture-controlled-robotic-car
Introduction:


		The aim of the project is to develop a human machine interface used for control robot arm. Our objective is to make this device simple as well as cheap so it can be produced and used for number of purposes. The objective of this project is to build a car that can be controlled by gesture wirelessly. In this project user is also able to control motions of the car by wearing controller glove and performing predefined gestures. This can be also used in many potential applications.
	 Radio receiver which receives the transmitted coded from the remote place these codes are converted to digital format and output is available to the pin no 2 of the ic2 master microcontroller; this is the pin of inbuilt art of the microcontroller. We Based on the input codes master will give command to slave microcontroller and robot will behave as follows. Moves in forward direction Moves in reverse direction, Speed controls in both the direction It can even turn left or right while moving forward or in reverse direction	
	This project has a wide range of applications. The major applications are :
	Security: The vehicle can be used for remote surveillance.
	Transportation: It can be used for very short distance transportation in various industries being efficient and price effective than earlier means. 
	Medical: The assembly can be used for making wheel chairs for handicapped  people which are control by gestures.
	Commercial: This technology can be used in making gesture controlled robotic arms for various industrial purposes.


Purpose,Scope and Limitation:


Gesture recognition can be considered as a way for computer to understand human body language. This has minimized the need for text interfaces and  GUI.The main purpose of this project is that  this model can  be used in military purposes, remote surveillance,  security purposes, gaming and entertainment.
	Firstly, since we are using Nrf24l01 for wireless transmission for  sending and receiving data the range is quite limited, The  maximum range that it can operate is 100m.This problem can be solved by using a GSM module for wireless transmission. It has a very large range.
	Secondly,  an on board camera can be installed for monitoring the robotic car. All we need here is a wireless camera which will broadcast and a receiver module which will provide live streaming.
These are just a handful of the places and situations in which gesture recognition technology can be implemented, and as is evident, can totally change the way we interact with the world around us, not only at home, but in commercial venues as well. In fact, a South African company had come up with an innovative machine placed at the Tambo International Airport that detected travellers who yawned or looked sleepy and dispensed free cups of coffee. Although it used only basic facial and gesture recognition technology, it is nonetheless an interesting look into what can be done with this technology.
